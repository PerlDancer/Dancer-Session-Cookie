Dancer::Session::Cookie - encrypted cookie-based
session backend for Dancer framework.

This module implements a session engine for sessions stored entirely
inside cookies. Usually only session id is stored in cookies and
the session data itself is saved in some external storage like
database. This module allows to avoid using external storage at
all.

Since we cannot trust any data provided by client in cookies, we use
cryptography to ensure secrecy and integrity.
